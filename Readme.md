# UDR Fused CNN Models

## Brief Description

Our methodology processes a holistic approach using Advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) ensembled for optimized results. UDR, a term coined for the combination of U-Net, DenseNet201, and ResNet50, achieves an impressive 91.43% accuracy. Further training and evaluation are performed using an optimized loss function.

### Research Focus

Holistic approach using U-Net, DenseNet201, ResNet50 (UDR) for the detection of multiclass disease classification in large-scale datasets, such as Breast cancer.

Cancer is the leading cause of mortality, with Breast cancer accounting for 27.7% of cases in women, demanding accurate classification strategies. Our research addresses the dynamic landscape of multiple cancer research and treatment approaches for large-scale datasets, including Breast cancer, Lung cancer, Alzheimer, etc.
